This is the CUNY CCNY version of PD Magnus's "For All X" Logic Text. It contains expanded sections in Fitch style natural deduction proofs.

It also includes a new chapter on the tableau, or "truth tree" method to determine validity, consistency, inconsistency, entailment, and equivelence in sentential and predicate logics.
