-This assignment was designed to enhance understanding of core concepts in an introductory logic course. Each worksheet requires students to apply logical principles they learn in class to different aspects of their own lives. The worksheets are then collected into a booklet that provides information (mostly in symbolic form) about their background, goals, and interests. After being checked for accuracy, the booklets created by one class can be used as teaching tools in subsequent classes. This allows future students to practice interpreting propositional logic sentences, truth tables, proofs, and Venn diagrams as they begin to learn these skills themselves.

-The aim of this approach is twofold. The most immediate goal is to bridge the gap between abstract principles and ``real-life'' applications, which students often have difficulty seeing even when many current examples are used in class. The second goal is to encourage students to see themselves as creators (not just consumers) of educational content while also giving them an opportunity to learn about issues that matter to their peers.

Each worksheet (with associated instructions) is independent of the others, so they can be completed in any order. The first time through it may be useful to demonstrate in class how each worksheet could be filled out, but in future semesters the work of past students can be used to illustrate various ways of completing the assignment.

-%\noindent Along with our textbook curriculum and readings, you will be working on an ``autobiography'' that expresses events, interests, and features of your life in logical form. Each section of the autobiography corresponds to a different formal or informal logic skill that we will study. We will devote time in class to drafting each part in a workshop-style setting. You will then revise the worksheets on your own, print out a clean copy, and put them together in a booklet at the end of the term.

Your paragraph should make it clear what fallacy is involved, and exactly where the reasoning in the prior paragraph goes wrong. Make sure to explain \textit{the specific problem with that particular argument, }rather than simply naming the fallacy and explaining the type of fallacy in general.

-\noindent Whichever option you choose, please avoid including personal information \textit{about anyone else }in a way that would make them uncomfortable. For instance, if a friend or teacher made an offensive assumption about you, or if you did so about them, please do not identify the particular person involved. The aim is to identify the fallacy and respond effectively to the mistake in reasoning, not to expose sensitive or potentially embarrassing information.

-\noindent Likewise, keep in mind that your worksheet should be PG-rated and suitable for a public audience. If the mistaken belief arose based on assumptions that are sexist, racist, homophobic, or otherwise hateful, you can convey the serious nature of the issue without expressing it using obscene or degrading language yourself. Recall that responding effectively to fallacies requires articulating the source of the error in a way that may change people's minds, rather than simply making them defensive.\textit{Fallacy Worksheet}

 \chapter{About this Book}
 
-This book was created by combining two previous books on logic and critical thinking, both made available under a Creative Commons license, and then adding some material so that the coverage matched that of commonly used logic textbooks.
-
-P.D. Magnus' \textit{For All} X \parencite*{Magnus2008} formed the basis of Part \ref{part:formal_logic}: Formal Logic. I began using \textit{For All} X in my own logic classes in 2009, but I quickly realized I needed to make changes to make it appropriate for the community college students I was teaching. In 2010 I began developing \textit{For All} X \textit{: The Lorain County Remix} and using it in my classes. The main change I made was to separate the discussions of sentential and quantificational logic and to add exercises. It is this remixed version that became the basis for Part \ref{part:formal_logic}: Formal Logic complete version of this text. 
-
-Similarly, Part \ref{part:CT}: Critical Thinking\iflabelexists{part:inductive_scientific}{ and Part \ref{part:inductive_scientific}: Inductive and Scientific Reasoning.}{ } grew out of Cathal Woods' \textit{Introduction to Reasoning}. In the Spring of 2011, I began to use an early version of this text (\cite{Woods2011}) in my critical thinking courses. I kept up with the updates and changes to the text until the release of \cite{Woods2014}, all the while gradually merging the material with the work in \textit{For All X}. After that point, my version forks from Woods's.

We have to say this, because there are systems of logic that allow for truth values besides ``true'' and ``false,'' like ``maybe true,'' or ``approximately true,'' or ``kinda sorta true.''

 As the above examples begin to indicate, English has all kinds of ways to negate a sentence.  Sometimes we use an explicit ``not.'' Sometimes we use a prefix like the ``ir-'' in ``irreplaceable.'' SL has just one way to form a negation: slap a \enot in front of the sentence. There is an English expression, however, that always occurs in the same place in an English sentence as the \enot occurs in the sentence SL. The English phrase is ``It is not the case that.'' Although this phrase sounds awkward, it always occurs in front of the sentence it is negating, just as the symbol \enot does. This makes it useful in translating sentences from SL back into English. $\enot R$ can be translated ``it is not the case that this widget is replaceable.'' In the earlier example, $\enot B$ can be translated ``It is not the case that Mary is in Barcelona.''

-One way of capturing the meaning of a sentential connective is to make a table which shows how the connective changes the meaning of the sentences it is applied to. The negation simply reverses the truth value of any sentence it is put in front of. For any sentence \script{A}: If \script{A} is true, then \enot\script{A} is false. If \enot\script{A} is true, then \script{A} is false. Using T for true and F for false, we can summarize this in a \emph{characteristic truth table} for negation:

 The English word ``or'' is somewhat ambiguous. Sometimes in English, when we say ``this or that,'' we mean that either option is possible, but not both. For instance, if a  restaurant menu says, ``Entr\'ees come with either soup or salad'' we naturally assume you can have soup, or you can have salad; but, if you want \emph{both} soup \emph{and} salad, then you will have to pay extra. This kind of disjunction is called an \textsc{\gls{exclusive or}} \label{def:exclusive_or}, because it excludes the possibility that both disjuncts are true. 
  
-At other times, the word ``or'' allows for the possibility that both disjuncts might be true. This is probably the case with sentence \ref{or2}, above.

 To goal of a formal language is to remove ambiguity, so we need to pick one of these ors. SL follows tradition and uses the symbol $\eor$ to represent an \emph{inclusive or}. This winds up being reflected in the characteristic truth table for the $\eor$. The sentence $D \eor E$ is true if $D$ is true, if $E$ is true, or if both $D$ and $E$ are true. It is false only if both $D$ and $E$ are false. The truth table looks like this:

 Remember on page \pageref{def:inclusive_or}, we said that the $\eor$ in SL represented an inclusive or. It said ``this or that or both.'' If we want to represent an exclusive or, we need to combine disjunction, conjuction and negation. We can break the sentence into two parts. The first part says that you get one or the other. We translate this as $(S_1 \eor S_2)$. The second part says that you do not get both. We can paraphrase this as ``It is not the case both that you get soup and that you get salad.'' Using both negation and conjunction, we translate this as $\enot(S_1 \eand S_2)$. Now we just need to put the two parts together. As we saw above, ``but'' can usually be translated as a conjunction. Sentence \ref{or.xor} can thus be translated as $(S_1 \eor S_2) \eand \enot(S_1 \eand S_2)$.

+Finally, the natural deduction method can be used to prove that a set of sentences are inconsistent. Recall our definition from
+Section~\ref{sec:consistency}: a set of sentences in English are said to be inconsistent if they cannot all be true at the same time. Otherwise
+they are consistent. 
+We were able to prove this semantic relationship in Chapter~\ref{chap:truth_tables} by drawing a truth table for
+every sentence in the set, and then inspecting the column under the main connective of each. If there was a single row in which every sentence
+contained a T, then it was determined to be logically consistent. If there is not a single row in which all members of the set contains a T, then it was
+determined to be logically inconsistent.
+
+When we say that a set of sentences is inconsistent, we sometimes also say that it ``contains a contradiction''. By this, we mean that logically, it is not possible for all of the
+statements to be true, taken together. However, more precisely, if a set of sentences is logically inconsistent, it does not ``contain" a contradiction: rather, from a set of inconsistent
+sentences one can derive a contradiction. It is this relationship that we will exploit in a derivation, using either the indirect proof, or conditional proof method. We can say that two
+statements are \textsc{\gls{syntactically logically inconsistent in SL}} \label{def:syntactically_logically_inconsistent_in_sl} if you can derive a contradiction from them.

-In the previous chapter, we expressed the fact that something could be proven a tautology using truth tables by writing the double turnstile in front of it.

Thus the above proof entitles us to write $\sststile{}{} \enot(G \eand \enot G)$.  
+Like invalid arguments, the natural deduction method cannot be used to show that a set of sentences is logically consistent, since the test for such a relationship
+would involve showing that a contradiction \emph{cannot} be derived. Of course, because of the strategic nature of the derivation rules, there is no independent
+rigorous test to distinguish between an attempted derivation in which no contradiction is logically possible, and one in which no derivation could be found.
+Since there are an infinite number of combinations of application of the derivation rules, but each derivation is finite, no such test can be performed.

-You may have wondered at that point if the two kinds of turnstiles always worked the same way. If you can show that \script{A} is a tautology using truth tables, can you also always show that it is true using a derivation? Is the reverse true? Are these things also true for tautologies and pairs of equivalent sentences? As it turns out, the answer to all these questions and many more like them is yes. We can show this by defining all these concepts separately and then proving them equivalent. That is, we imagine that we actually have two notions of validity, $valid_{\models}$ and  $valid_{\vdash}$ and then show that the two concepts always work the same way. 
+You may have wondered at that point if the two kinds of turnstiles always worked the same way. If you can show that \script{A} is a tautology using truth tables, can you also always show 
+that it is true using a derivation? Is the reverse true? Are these things also true for tautologies and pairs of equivalent sentences? As it turns out, the answer to all these questions 
+and many more like them is yes. We can show this by defining all these concepts separately and then proving them equivalent. That is, we imagine that we actually have two notions of 
+validity, $valid_{\models}$ and $valid_{\vdash}$ and then show that the two concepts always work the same way.
