\chapter{About this Book}

This book was created by combining two previous books on logic and critical thinking, both made available under a Creative Commons license, and then adding some material so that the
coverage matched that of commonly used logic textbooks.

Cathal Woods' \textit{Introduction to Reasoning}.
