#Changes November 17
I made changes to a number of the chapters to correct missing or incorrect \label or \ref tags.

I added a section in chapter 8 on inconsistency in SD, and also included practice questions to that chapter.

I found an incomplete reference in the text to a summary of the derivation rules. Since that summary didn't exist, i created it, and then cleaned up the \label and \ref.

A few typoes hre and theree.
